/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Product` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Product` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `ProductImage` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `ProductImage` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[slug]` on the table `Product` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `slug` to the `Product` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `productId` on the `ProductImage` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
